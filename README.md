# MongoDBExmaples
these are some little examples following this playlist "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSM8fkP9ppPpE7lz9GthKgvOZQD2EwqZ0"
the main goal was to try some no-sql examples.
to run this project:
  1- create your mongoDB database (in this example "zadb")
  2- run your mongoDB server "mongod -dbpath 'your database path' --smallfiles"
  3- create a new user on this database for example username: "zauser" and password: "password"
  4- run the application (firstExample classes or the second one), each one is running as main class.
  --you can insert, update, delete and findAll in the second example--
